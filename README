Dimscape is a navigator and editor for a multi-dimensional database structure termed a ZZStructure by Project Xanadu. It is written in Python and makes heavy use of the python Qt bindings.

Arrow keys: basic up-down-left-right navigation from cell to cell
Ctrl-Up/Ctrl-Down: move posward (toward you)/negward (toward screen) in the Z dimension

c: create a new cell as prompted
l/L: create/remove a link between two cells as prompted
r: remove a neighboring cell as prompted
d: create a new dimension
x/X: cycle forward/backward through the dimensions bound to the X direction
y/Y: cycle forward/backward through the dimensions bound to the Y direction
z/Z: cycle forward/backward through the dimensions bound to the Z direction
s: swap the dimensions bound to the X and Y directions
i: edit a text cell, press ESC to return to normal navigation
Enter: execute the contents of a cell, for video cells this toggles play/pause
